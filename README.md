//////...Project Personal Resume Website...//////

The goal of this project is to practice working with HTML and CSS
We will be creating an one page resume with all relevant informations and link of own

***Use_Only_CSS_&_HTML_to_work_On_it**



Steps:

Create a new folder on your local computer with the name: personal-resume-website
Create an index.html file with the general template code
Create a style.css file and add this to your HTML file as <link> (check how to add CSS to an HTML file)
Make sure you have My Resume App as the title in your HTML (this will show in the tab when your app runs in the browser)
Build the page according to the example (try to use "poppins and sansarif" as a font) add the link from google and attest it at the top of css.
Use your professional photographs you to give it an elegant look
Use flex box or grid to work with layout. 
Feel free to use Bootstrap if you also want to practise that ðŸ˜Š
