## Project Online Resume

### The goal of this project is to practice working with HTML and CSS.

**Basic functionality:** We will be creating a web page with your personal resume, with all relevant information and links, for example to your LinkedIn profile and GitHub account.

Below is an example of a resume webpage:

<img src="./examples/full_sample.png" width="600" />
