## Project Online Resume

### The goal of this project is to practice working with HTML and CSS.

**Basic functionality:** We will be creating a web page with your personal resume, with all relevant information and links, for example to your LinkedIn profile and GitHub account.

Below is an example of a resume webpage:

<img src="./examples/full_sample.png" width="500" />

To see the page in more detail, have a look in the `examples` folder. There are screenshots of the full resume page, and of the top and bottom parts separately.

### For starters

1. Create a new folder on your local computer with the name: personal-resume-website
1. Track your code with Git by using git init in the terminal
2. Create an index.html file with the general template code
4. Create a style.css file and add this to your HTML file as a <link>
5. Make sure you have **Resume *yourname*** as the title in the HTML (this will show in the tab when your app runs in the browser)
6. Build the page according to the example (try to use "poppins and sansarif" as a font) add the link from google and attest it at the top of css.
7. Use your professional photographs of your to give it an elegant look
8. Use flex box or grid to work with layout. 
9. Feel free to use Bootstrap if you also want to practise that ðŸ˜Š
10. For icons visit this page <https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/icons/>
11. To access those icons go to this route  <https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome> and and copy the cdn link &  add this in your html header.
12. Use media querie to make it responsive.
